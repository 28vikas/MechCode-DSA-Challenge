# 🚀 Day 04 – Loops in JavaScript

Today I learned about **for loop** and **while loop** from Namaste DSA
Loops are one of the most important concepts in programming — they help us execute code multiple times without writing it again and again.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- Looping through arrays
- Function calls inside loops
